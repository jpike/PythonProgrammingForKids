def PrintGreeting():
    # Here is the body of our function, which contains the block
    # or lines of code that will be executed when our function is
    # called.  A function body can contain any code just like
    # our previous Python programs.
    # Note how the body of the function is indented once more
    # from the first line of the function definition above.
    print("Hello!")
 
# Here is where we're calling our function.  Without the line below,
# the code in our function would not execute, and our program would
# do nothing.
# Notice how we call the function - the function's name ("PrintGreeting"),
# followed by parentheses "()".
PrintGreeting()
