# File Systems and the Command Line

Understanding computer file systems is important for anyone wanting to effectively use computers,
and command line interfaces are critical for anyone wanting to become an effective programmer.
The slides below give an introduction to these concepts.

After you've gone through the material under [Python Basics](../python_basics/index.md), then a challenging exercise
would be to code your own "command prompt" in Python.  It should support at least the following commands:
- dir
- mkdir
- cd

Of course, you can also add more commands.  A command to print out the contents of a file or create a new file
would be good additional commands to add.
