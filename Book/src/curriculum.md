# Curriculum

This outlines the current curriculum for training kids in Python programming with an emphasis on game programming.
It is recommended that each kid have a separate copy of the curriculum (either physical or digital) and keep
track of what he/she has completed - this will help mentors better figure out appropriate exercises to help
kids learning and developing skill.

The master Google spreadsheet for the curriculum can be found at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVofrxnqEGPm0r5NHuMFwI-jIrs5xC5zQ1ZVhLx11o0/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVofrxnqEGPm0r5NHuMFwI-jIrs5xC5zQ1ZVhLx11o0/)
(which you can download/copy if you want a digital copy or print if you want your own physical copy).
