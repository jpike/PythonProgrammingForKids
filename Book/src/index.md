# Introduction

This online book is intended to be supplementary material to help kids learn programming using the Python programming language and the Pygame library.  The specific focus is on game programming, a fun way to learn programming.

This book aims to make use of other existing resources out there, organizing things in a way to help beginning kids develop programming skills over the long-term.  However, some custom resources include:
- [Curriculum](./curriculum.md) - The main curriculum linking to more specific resources.
- [GitHub Repository with Example Code](https://github.com/jpike/PythonProgrammingForKids)
- [YouTube Playlist on Developing a Custom Game in Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lXoYA0xCfI1ll7qIwW05cL6ynVdubOA)
