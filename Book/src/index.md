# Introduction

This online book is intended to be supplementary material to help kids learn programming using the Python programming language and the Pygame library.  The specific focus is on game programming, a fun way to learn programming.

This book aims to make use of other existing resources out there, organizing things in a way to help beginning kids develop programming skills over the long-term.  However, some custom resources include:
- [Curriculum](./curriculum.md) - The main curriculum linking to more specific resources.
- [GitHub Repository with Example Code](https://github.com/jpike/PythonProgrammingForKids)
- [YouTube Playlist on Developing a Custom Game in Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lXoYA0xCfI1ll7qIwW05cL6ynVdubOA)

There are lots of additional resources out there, so this book can't feasibly link to everything.
Instead, it aims to carefully curate resources based on the above goals.
For general information on Python, the official documentation at <https://docs.python.org/3/index.html>
can be useful.  Within the "Doc" subfolder of a Python installation on Windows, a .chm file also exists
that contains official documentation for use offline.
