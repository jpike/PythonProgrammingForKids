# Quiz 1

After you've gone through the material thus far under "Python Basics", the following quiz
may help reinforce the material covered so far.  You should strive to make sure you can
answer the questions 100% correctly if given this quiz on-the-spot before moving much
further in the curriculum.  If you print out the quiz, fill it out, and bring your copy
to a meetup, a mentor will be happy to check your answers and review with you.
