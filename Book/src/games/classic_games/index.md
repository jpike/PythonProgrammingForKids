# Classic Game Recreation

This section gives you some tips on re-creating some classic games.

See the sub-sections in the left side-bar for details on specific games.

In general, you can use whatever programming libraries (tkinter, pygame, etc.)
that you want to try and re-create these classic games.  Pygame is recommended
but not required.
