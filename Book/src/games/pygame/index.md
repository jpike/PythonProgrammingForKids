# Pygame

[Curriculum](../../Pygame.html)

[Pygame](https://pygame.org/) is a Python library for graphics and game programming.

Installation
------------
Pygame is not included with Python by default, so you'll need to download and install it separately.
To install Pygame, you'll need to open a command line interface (command prompt, terminal) on your computer
(possibly with administrator privileges) and then run a command like one of the following:
```
pip install pygame
pip3 install pygame
python -m pip install pygame
python3 -m pip install pygame
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```
If you have installation troubles, see the following:

Official Documentation
-----------------------
The official Pygame documentation is at <https://www.pygame.org/docs/>.  If you're ever unsure about
how something works in Pygame or what features it provides, it's useful to read the documentation to
try and figure out answers to your questions.  This is an important skill to have.
