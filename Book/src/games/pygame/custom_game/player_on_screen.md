# Keeping Player On Screen

To keep the player on screen, we need to use logic (code) that is similar to
what we did for [keeping the collectible on screen](./collecting_collectible.md)
and [checking if the enemy moved outside of the screen](./enemy_movement.md).
THe only difference is that we need to apply this logic to operate on our
player x and y position variables.

As an additional challenge, apply similar logic to ensure that the enemy
always remains on screen.
