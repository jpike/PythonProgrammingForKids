# Custom Game

This section of this online book covers creation of a custom game basically
from scratch using the [Pygame library](https://pygame.org).

A [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lXoYA0xCfI1ll7qIwW05cL6ynVdubOA)
exists with videos showing how to program the game.  Code for various iterations of the game
code are available [GitHub](https://github.com/jpike/PythonProgrammingForKids/tree/master/Pygame).
